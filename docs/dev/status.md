# Status

What's true of Dragoon today, measured on one machine. Build numbers are from a clean
build directory at gcn-recomp `67a7e30`, and the game was run at `7d30377`.

| Feature | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Boot and memory card | Works | A blank card gets the game's prompt by frame 60, and the save file is made |
| Opening movie | Plays | Then the title and the attract demos, races and mode movies |
| Title screen | Works | `tests/routes/title.txt` |
| Mode select | Works | `tests/routes/menu.txt`. The panel at its right stays plain gray |
| Air Ride race | Runs | `tests/routes/air-ride-race.txt`. Fantasy Meadows, three CPUs, three laps to the results screen with nobody steering |
| City Trial | Runs | `tests/routes/city-trial.txt`. One player, the five-minute clock running. Stadium not reached yet |
| Top Ride | Not tried | |
| Audio | Partial | Details in `audio.md` |
| Controllers | Port 1 only | gcn-recomp connects one pad |
| Picture | 4:3 | gcn-recomp letterboxes the desktop window to 4:3 |
| Speed | See below | About 500 frames a second in a race, hidden window, `--fast` |
| Build from the disc | Works | 23 s from an empty build directory: 3.5 s to configure, 19.5 s for Ninja |
| Disc check | Works | The wrong disc stops the configure step with the disc ID it found |
| `.gcm` dumps | Work | Linked as `rom/game.iso`, or passed as `-DGAME_ISO=<path>` |
| Disc path with spaces | Works | Configures, and its `dragoon_bench` builds and runs |
| Running from another directory | Works | The configured disc path is compiled in |
| Network during the build | None | No downloads or FetchContent on macOS. SDL2 comes from Homebrew through pkg-config |
| Idle loop | Works | `recomp/idle.txt` 803D9FCC is the `IDLE_CHECK` branch in the generated C |

## The build

Measured on an Apple M4 Max (16 cores, 48 GB) on macOS 26.6.2 with the Command Line Tools
SDK 26.5, Apple clang 21.0.0, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja 1.13.2, Python 3.14.7 and SDL2 2.32.72.

```sh
ln -s "/path/to/Kirby Air Ride (USA).gcm" rom/game.iso
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX26.5.sdk
ninja -C build
```

| Step | Wall | CPU | Peak memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configure (extract `main.dol`, recompile to C) | 3.5 s | 3.5 s | 99 MB |
| Ninja (183 steps, 137 generated C files plus the runtime) | 19.5 s | 269 s | 684 MB, the largest single process |

Peak memory is the maximum resident set of one process from `/usr/bin/time -l`, not the sum
of the parallel jobs.

| Output | Size |
|---|---|
| `build/` | 631 MB |
| `build/gen/` (generated C) | 101 MB |
| `build/dragoon` | 51.0 MB |
| `build/dragoon_bench` | 50.8 MB |
| `build/libgame_recomp.a` | 195 MB |

The recompiler reads 20,003 functions from `analysis/symbols.txt` and finds 4,573 jump table
targets. It reports no unimplemented instructions and one warning.

```
warning: 803D2C78 branches to non-code 00000060
```

803D2C78 sits between `__OSDBINTEND` and `__OSDBJUMPEND`, the SDK's debugger stub that
jumps to the exception vector at 0x60. The stub is copied to low memory and never runs from
where it sits, so the warning is harmless. The compiler adds one warning, in gcn-recomp's own
renderer.

```
runtime/gx/render_gl.cpp:3189:13: warning: enumeration value 'Screen' not handled in switch [-Wswitch]
```

## Disc inputs

gcn-recomp looks only for `rom/*.iso` and `rom/*.ciso`. A `.gcm` is the same format as an
`.iso`, so a symlink named `rom/game.iso` builds. So does
`-DGAME_ISO="/path/to/Kirby Air Ride (USA).gcm"`, spaces and all. A `dragoon_bench` built
that way and run from a directory outside the repo found the disc through the compiled-in
path.

The wrong disc fails at configure, before anything compiles. With Super Mario Sunshine passed
as `GAME_ISO`, `recomp/extract_dol.py` prints this and CMake stops.

```
error: .../Super Mario Sunshine (USA, Canada).gcm is disc b'GMSE01', not b'GKYE01'.
Note: only uncompressed .iso and .ciso images are supported; convert .rvz/.gcz first (see README).
CMake Error at gcn-recomp/CMakeLists.txt:280 (message):
  could not extract main.dol from
```

The disc IDs come out as Python byte strings, and the note about `.rvz` is beside the point
for a wrong disc. Both are gcn-recomp's wording.

`build/dragoon_bench --seconds=20`, run from a directory outside the repo, found
`rom/game.iso` through the path compiled in at configure time. With nobody at the controls it
sits at the memory card prompt and reports 4,770 frames a second there, which says nothing
about speed in play.

## How far it gets

Every checkpoint below was reached by a route in `tests/routes/` from a blank memory card,
run with `tools/probe.sh` (hidden window, `--fast`, 640x480).

| Checkpoint | Route | Frame | What's on screen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Memory card | `title.txt` | 60 | The prompt to make a save file on the card in slot A |
| Title | `title.txt` | 960 | The logo and PRESS START/PAUSE |
| Mode select | `menu.txt` | 1200 | Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, Options, LAN |
| Air Ride race | `air-ride-race.txt` | 4200 | Fantasy Meadows, lap 1, 0:14 on the clock, CPUs ahead |
| City Trial | `city-trial.txt` | 3300 | The city, 4:54 left |

Left alone, the race route finishes three laps in 1:12.60 and reaches the results screen by
frame 25,800. City Trial with nobody steering drives into the sea and stays there while the
clock runs. The opening movie, when it isn't skipped, plays to the end and hands over to the
title and the attract demos.

The race runs at about 500 frames a second in the hidden window with `--fast`, 8 times the
game's 60. That's 9,600 frames between frames 3600 and 13,200 in 19.3 s of wall time, with
other work on the machine at the time.

## Fixes on the way

Two things stopped the game. Both were generic, so both are in gcn-recomp.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `FATAL: MMU: access to 75730040 with no page table` when the opening movie ended, and a second into every race | The effects code (`kar_efanime__near_80240084`) calls `setjmp` (803AE238) before it walks an animation tree. Its callback (8023F4E4) calls `longjmp` (803AE33C) to stop the walk. Recompiled, `longjmp` restored the stack pointer of the outer frame and then returned into the callback, and the code after it ran on the wrong stack frame | gcn-recomp `b326dcd` lets `special_calls.txt` name a `setjmp` and `longjmp`. A call site of `setjmp` records a host resume point, and `longjmp` goes there once it has restored the registers. `recomp/special_calls.txt` and `recomp/names.txt` name the pair |
| A race showed the HUD on plain sky blue | The frame's first draw is a sky quad at the far end of the frustum with a Z8 replace Z texture (texel 0xFF, bias 0). The depth test is set to run before texturing, so on the console the quad writes its own far depth. The renderer wrote the texel's depth instead (0x0000FF), and every later draw failed the test | gcn-recomp `7d30377` leaves the Z texture out of the depth when the test runs before texturing |

`analysis/symbols.txt` calls 803AE238 `ExPPC_UnwindStack` and 803AE33C
`ExPPC_IsInSpecification`. Their code is the C library's `setjmp` and `longjmp`, and
`recomp/names.txt` renames them.
