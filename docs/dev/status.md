# Status

What's true of Dragoon today, measured on one machine. Build numbers are from a clean
build directory at gcn-recomp `67a7e30`.

| Feature | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Build from the disc | Works | 23 s from an empty build directory: 3.5 s to configure, 19.5 s for Ninja |
| Disc check | Works | The wrong disc stops the configure step with the disc ID it found |
| `.gcm` dumps | Work | Linked as `rom/game.iso`, or passed as `-DGAME_ISO=<path>` |
| Disc path with spaces | Works | Configures, and its `dragoon_bench` builds and runs |
| Running from another directory | Works | The configured disc path is compiled in |
| Network during the build | None | No downloads or FetchContent on macOS. SDL2 comes from Homebrew through pkg-config |
| Idle loop | Works | `recomp/idle.txt` 803D9FCC is the `IDLE_CHECK` branch in the generated C |

## The build

Measured on an Apple M4 Max (16 cores, 48 GB) on macOS 26.6.2 with the Command Line Tools
SDK 26.5, Apple clang 21.0.0, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja 1.13.2, Python 3.14.7 and SDL2 2.32.72.

```sh
ln -s "/path/to/Kirby Air Ride (USA).gcm" rom/game.iso
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX26.5.sdk
ninja -C build
```

| Step | Wall | CPU | Peak memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configure (extract `main.dol`, recompile to C) | 3.5 s | 3.5 s | 99 MB |
| Ninja (183 steps, 137 generated C files plus the runtime) | 19.5 s | 269 s | 684 MB, the largest single process |

Peak memory is the maximum resident set of one process from `/usr/bin/time -l`, not the sum
of the parallel jobs.

| Output | Size |
|---|---|
| `build/` | 631 MB |
| `build/gen/` (generated C) | 101 MB |
| `build/dragoon` | 51.0 MB |
| `build/dragoon_bench` | 50.8 MB |
| `build/libgame_recomp.a` | 195 MB |

The recompiler reads 20,003 functions from `analysis/symbols.txt` and finds 4,573 jump table
targets. It reports no unimplemented instructions and one warning.

```
warning: 803D2C78 branches to non-code 00000060
```

803D2C78 sits between `__OSDBINTEND` and `__OSDBJUMPEND`, the SDK's debugger stub that
jumps to the exception vector at 0x60. The stub is copied to low memory and never runs from
where it sits, so the warning is harmless. The compiler adds one warning, in gcn-recomp's own
renderer.

```
runtime/gx/render_gl.cpp:3189:13: warning: enumeration value 'Screen' not handled in switch [-Wswitch]
```

## Disc inputs

gcn-recomp looks only for `rom/*.iso` and `rom/*.ciso`. A `.gcm` is the same format as an
`.iso`, so a symlink named `rom/game.iso` builds. So does
`-DGAME_ISO="/path/to/Kirby Air Ride (USA).gcm"`, spaces and all. A `dragoon_bench` built
that way and run from a directory outside the repo found the disc through the compiled-in
path.

The wrong disc fails at configure, before anything compiles. With Super Mario Sunshine passed
as `GAME_ISO`, `recomp/extract_dol.py` prints this and CMake stops.

```
error: .../Super Mario Sunshine (USA, Canada).gcm is disc b'GMSE01', not b'GKYE01'.
Note: only uncompressed .iso and .ciso images are supported; convert .rvz/.gcz first (see README).
CMake Error at gcn-recomp/CMakeLists.txt:280 (message):
  could not extract main.dol from
```

The disc IDs come out as Python byte strings, and the note about `.rvz` is beside the point
for a wrong disc. Both are gcn-recomp's wording.

`build/dragoon_bench --seconds=20`, run from a directory outside the repo, found
`rom/game.iso` through the path compiled in at configure time. With nobody at the controls it
sits at the memory card prompt and reports 4,770 frames a second there, which says nothing
about speed in play.
